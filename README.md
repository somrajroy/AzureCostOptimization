#### [To be completed] Cloud Cost Optimization - Microsoft Azure <br/><br/>
* Cloud cost can skyrocket due to various reasons. Each service can have its own cost optimization techniques but in general below are some strategies which can be followed to reduce cost in Azure. <br/>
* There are three fundamental drivers of cost in Cloud which should be kept in mind while architecting solutions : compute, storage, and outbound data transfer. <br/>
* Additionally there are 3 types of Azure Cost Optimization Techniques : Resource-based, Usage-based and Pricing-based. <br/>
* [According to Microsoft Azure WAF(well architected framework)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/framework/#cost-optimization) - focus should be on generating incremental value early. [Comprehensive WAF Cost Optimization documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/framework/cost/).<br/>
* Below are some key cost optimization strategies. (Each service can have its own specific optimization technique which are not covered here - for e.g. SQL elastic pools or Azure AKS has some best practices to run workloads in lowest price point) <br/><br/>
  * Review Pricing and Billing Information : Azure provides billing details explaining the cost of cloud services. This information can be leveraged to identify high-cost areas and generate savings. Understanding cloud costs helps in informed decisions <br/>
  * Start early with cost optimization : This includes Azure services, tools, and resources to organize and track cost and usage data, enhance control through consolidated billing and access permission, enable better planning through budgeting and forecasts, and further lower cost with resources and pricing optimizations. [7 ways to optimize costs in Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/solutions/cost-optimization/#ways-to-optimize) <br/>
  * Choose right pricing model (payment options) for the use case : Opt for reserved or spot instances. Flexibility is key for business <br/>
  * Set budgets : Cloud costs can be controlled by ensuring everyone knows the goals and budgets of each project. Setting a monthly budget to plan is a good step <br/>
  * Implement processes to identify resource waste (or idle resources) : A cloud cost optimization strategy helps identify unused and unattached resources and remove them to eliminate unnecessary expenses. Resources should be de-provisioned immediately when job finishes. For example [Delete unattached disks](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/windows/find-unattached-disks), idle load balancers etc. (for example locate unused virtual disks via the Disks screen in Azure portal. Here, all active managed virtual disks in  current storage account is shown, and identify any without an owner which would imply it’s empty & delete.) <br/>
  * Tag Azure resources : A good resource tagging policy can save costs. For example, resources with non-production tags can be de-provisioned or shut down in holidays or when not used. Tags helps to analyze and attribute expenditure. Tags makes it easier to accurately identify the usage and cost of systems, which then allows transparent attribution of IT costs to individual workload owners. This helps measure return on investment (ROI) and gives workload owners an opportunity to optimize their resources and reduce costs. Tagging resources increases the amount of data monitoring tools can obtain.<br/>
  * [Refer Azure Advisor](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/advisor/#features) recommendations regularly and take actions if needed. [Azure Advisor helps in reducing cost & increasing operational excellence.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/advisor/advisor-overview)  <br/>
  * Right size services/resources : [For example to right size VM's start with four main metrics](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/advisor/advisor-cost-recommendations) - CPU, memory, I/O and networking. [Azure cost optimization & Right Sizing Full list](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/advisor/advisor-reference-cost-recommendations)<br/>
  * Have capacity planning : use autoscaling of resources to avoid overspend <br/>
  * Limit data transfer fees : for e.g. use private endpoints. Ensure that systems that swap a lot of data are together in same cloud/region. Start with an assessment of cloud provider's transfer fees. Then, adjust the cloud architecture to minimize the necessary data transfers. For example, move on-premises applications that frequently access cloud-hosted data into the cloud to eliminate hops.<br/>
  * Azure Hybrid Benefit (AHB)/Bring-your-own-license (BYOL) : Azure Hybrid Benefit is a licensing benefit that helps to significantly reduce the costs of running workloads in Azure Cloud. Its an azure based program that providing BYOL to Azure and it available for Enterprise customers with Software Assurance that provides license mobility. It works by reuse on-premises Software Assurance-enabled Windows Server, RedHat, SUSE and SQL Server licenses on Azure. Azure Hybrid Benefit can lead to the highest level of savings on VMs i.e. up to 82% off pay-as-you-go pricing. <br/>
  * Use Azure cost monitoring tools regularly : Azure Cost Management + Billing. This suite of tools tracks spending across individual Azure services, provides future bill forecasts and alerts users when they go over budget. Cost Management is a free tool built into the Azure portal. It collects data and enables analysis that can help save costs on Azure services. Azure provides additional tools for cost planning and optimization, including the Azure Advisor, Cost Calculator, Cost Analysis, Azure Budgets, and Cloudyn, which lets track resource usage and expenditure for Azure alongside other clouds. <br/>
  * Azure cost analysis : Once workloads run in Azure, use the cost analysis feature in the Azure portal to understand how much each workload will cost. This tool also forecasts future spending based on current configurations.<br/>
  * [Leverage Azure Dev/Test Pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/dev-test/) :  Azure provides deep discounts on services if they are used for development and testing: For example Run Windows and SQL Server VMs with no charge for Microsoft software (same price as Linux instances), Up to 55% discount on Azure SQL Database,Up to 50% discount on Logic Apps etc. <br/>
  * [Leverage B-series VMs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/sizes-b-series-burstable) : B-Series VMs grant discounts of between 15-55% compared to equivalent VMs. Identify if there are workloads that need to be available but only occasionally require high performance or throughput, and can be moved  to B-Series VMs. Azure offers B-Series virtual machines, designed for applications that are typically idle and then have sudden bursts of usage. A B-Series VM usually runs with a low, baseline level of CPU power, and as long as this low level is suitable for the workload, customers accumulate credits which can be utlized in "bursts".  <br/>
  * Prevent cloud sprawl <br/>
  * Cache storage strategically <br/>
  * Make use of storage tiering : Storage can become very costly is not optimized properly. Azure Blob Storage model offers Premium, Hot, Cool, and Archive storage tiers with pricing to match, so customers can discover what’s right for them. Less frequent data can be archieved.<br/>
  * Base VMs stop/start schedule on your usage : it’s highly recommended to perform an analysis of usage patterns and availability so as to create a VM stop/start schedule that is optimal. This custom scheduling can be combined with autoscaling for better cost-effectiveness in the long run.  Azure Automation Runbooks gives the tools needed to implement automatic stop/start functions (can be very helpful for non-production enviornments). <br/>
  * Switch workloads to containers : Check workload affinity and consider switching to containers. Hosting costs will reduce. Although it’s not always possible, aim should always be for 100% VM utilization to ensure costs are optimal. This can be done by monitoring metrics with Azure Monitor and using auto-scaling. <br/>
  * Serverless : This can save lot of costs. Serverless functions runs on demand, based on user-defined triggers. Serverless computing is best suited for compute-intensive workloads that run intermittently.<br/>
  * Avoid undifferentiated heavy lifting and leverage managed services : For example moving away from traditional databases to PaaS options (elastic databases). <br/>
  * Identify and minimize Software License Costs : Software licensing is a major component of cloud operating costs. Manual license management is challenging, increasing the risk of paying for unused software licenses. <br/>
